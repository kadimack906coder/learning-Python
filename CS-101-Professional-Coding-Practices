# CS 101 Wk 6 Python Notes
Starting with Lesson 10 (because I just discovered GitHub!!)

### reusable functions
example discount calculator:

```python
def apply_discount(price, discount_percent):
    discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
    final_price = price - discount_amount
    return final_price

# Use the function
item_price = 50
discount = 20

new_price = apply_discount(item_price, discount)
print("Final price after discount:", new_price)```
